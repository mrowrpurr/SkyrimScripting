> _A series of tutorial screencasts_

---

👋 Hey y'all, @mrowrpurr here.

I'm a new Skyrim modder ( _long time software developer_ )

I want to share with you everything that I'm learning in my Skyrim modding journey 🛣️

# Skyrim Scripting

As a programmer, I am in love with the programming aspects of authoring mods!

Hence the screencast series name, "_**Skyrim Scripting**_"

I have a couple of goals with this screencasting series:

1. Get y'all setup to create your **first mod** easily ( _in less than 20 minutes_ )
2. Get y'all an _efficient_ and _enjoyable_ **local development environment** ( _with debugging tools_ )
3. Get y'all acquainted with some of the **most common modding tools** which you'll need
4. Get y'all **super comfortable** making new simply mods _really quickly_ and _painlessly_
5. Get y'all posting your mods to **GitHub**, **Nexus Mods**, **Lovers Lab**\*, and/or other sites
6. Teach y'all some of the **basics** _as I learn them myself!_
7. Share various miscellaneous videos, mostly creating **libraries and utilities** for other modders!

> \* FYI: Lovers Lab has plenty of NSFW content ( _but it's also a very popular place for SFW content_ )
